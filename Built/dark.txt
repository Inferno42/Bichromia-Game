you wake up in a pile of soot, your chest spasming as you cough violently.
The mangled trees sprawl as the once beautiful trees finally give to their impending death
Animals have not shown themselves for months as the ash relentlessly poisons the earth.
The village ahead shows little signs of life, many have died due to the black clouds hovering above.
The sign reads: High ash concentration, respirator recommended by council of village healthcare.
Most of the homes seems condemned, this place is a ghost town.
The young boy seems to be hacking up blood, his gaze begs for you to save him.
The young girl holds a hand out, begging for money to help feed her family.
The old man coughs small clouds of ash from his lungs, he will not last long.
That village will not last long, the sun is shrowded by dark clouds, this is truly its final hour...
