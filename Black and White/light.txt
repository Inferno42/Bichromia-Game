you wake up in a pile of beautiful snow, winter arrived recently.
The tops of the trees are gently frosted with the white sheet coating the land.
The forest seems quiet with all the animals hibernating in their homes safe and sound.
The village up ahead shines with the lights of people's homes.
The sign reads: Welcome to Havenbrook, home to the happiest village on earth!
Most everyone in the village seems to be resting comfortably in their beds.
The young boy seems to be playing in the dirt, best leave him to it.
The young girl asks if you've seen her friend, she seems to be playing hide and seek.
The old man mumbles to himself about the cold weather
The edge of the village seems beautiful today. Just as it always has...
