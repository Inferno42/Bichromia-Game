A man wakes up in a pile of soot, his chest spasming as he coughs violently.
The mangled trees sprawl as the once beautiful trees finally give to their impending death
Animals have not shown themselves for months as the soot relentlessly poisons the earth.
The village shows little signs of life, many have died due to the black clouds hovering above.
