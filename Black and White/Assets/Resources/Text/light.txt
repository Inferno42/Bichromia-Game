A man wakes up in a pile of beautiful snow, winter came recently.
The tops of the trees are gently frosted with the white sheet coating the land.
The forest seems quiet with all the animals hibernating in their homes safe and sound.
The village up ahead echoes with the sound of children laughing and playing.
