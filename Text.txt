A man wakes up in a pile of beautiful snow, winter came recently.						A man wakes up in a pile of soot, his chest spasming as he coughs violently.
The tops of the trees are gently frosted with the white sheet coating the land.				The mangled trees sprawl as the once beautiful trees finally give to their impending death
The forest seems quiet with all the animals hibernating in their homes safe and sound.				Animals have not shown themselves for months as the soot relentlessly poisons the earth.
The village up ahead echoes with the sound of children laughing and playing.				The village shows little signs of life, many have died due to the black clouds hovering above.
